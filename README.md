# Gain any power of the main character of any show you watch
---
## Purpose
 In class we were given prompts and had the task to create a story line for that prompt with a partner. Our prompt is about getting any power of the main character in any show that you watch and so we have to use that to create a story line that branches off with different situations and choices you can pick for different endings.
